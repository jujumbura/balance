- Probably need to convert the attributes return from submitFields into a map,
  getting values by array index is cumbersome and risky for the caller

- Come up with common state structure, ie:

	[Header]
	until_valid {
		- prompt
		input: ...
	}
	::change
	> transition

- Rework input parsing so that whitespace can be handled between quotes ( walk the string )

- Format list output with aligned columns

- Prompt user before making changes to data ( yes no )
