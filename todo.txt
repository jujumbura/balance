- Probably need to convert the attributes return from submitFields into a map,
  getting values by array index is cumbersome and risky for the caller

[DONE]

- Come up with common state structure, ie:

	[Header]
	until_valid {
		- prompt
		input: ...
	}
	::change
	> transition

[DONE]

- Rework input parsing so that whitespace can be handled between quotes ( walk the string )

[ DONE ]

- Format list output with aligned columns

[ DONE ]

- Prompt user before making changes to data ( yes no )

[ DONE ]

- Swap to "proxy" for the params/descs/objs used for data in the different components

[ DONE ]

- Use "string-similar" library for close matches on find/edit

- Handle the case where a group was removed that contains products ( remove id on product entries? )

[ DONE ]

- Fix date print
